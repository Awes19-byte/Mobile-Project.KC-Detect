# Corneal Deformations Detection on Android using TFLite 
This project aim is to determine if a Deep Learning and a mobile device can be used to
help diagnose corneal abnormalities. The hypothesis is that an image taken from a mobile
device of corneal topography image and can be utilised for automatic diagnosis of abnor-
malities and deformations detection. Diagnosis would be without the need for specialised
imaging equipment. As corneal abnormalities are quite prevalent in the developing world
and frequent access to an ophthalmologist is rare, it would be advantageous if any medical
professional could give a preliminary diagnosis and begin treatment or get specialised care
for their patient.
